## Problem Analysis & Requirements
---
#### Problem Statement
Our restaurant partners currently do not have transparency about their ranking on different platforms. As the ranking is an important driver of revenue, we want to help them by making the **real-time ranking** and the **historical ranking of the Lieferando platform** more transparent. This then can lead to a better analysis of the ranking and help to understand patterns and increase revenue in the future.

#### Application Requirements / Success Criteria
1. Retrieving the current ranking ad-hoc through a REST API
2. Logging the ranking of a given list of partners in intervals of at most 60 mins
3. Historical data storage and access through DB
4. Support for multiple restaurant locations / slugs
